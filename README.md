# What-The-Code ðŸš€

Welcome to **What-The-Code** â€“ the VS Code extension thatâ€™s like having a super-powered, code-obsessed sidekick (minus the spandex). Whether youâ€™re a coding wizard or just trying to survive your next project, this tool is here to make your life easier, cleaner, and a lot more fun.

## What does it do?

- **Ask your code anything!** (in plain English, no jargon required)
- **Find and zap dead code** (unused stuff hiding in your files)
- **Save file snapshots** before you break things (and restore them when you do)

No PhD in computer science required. Just install, plug in your Gemini API key, and let the magic happen. âœ¨

## How to Get Started

1. **Install** from the VS Code Marketplace (itâ€™s free, and so is the good karma)
2. **Grab a Gemini API key** from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) (takes 2 minutes, promise)
3. **Pop your API key** into VS Code settings (search for "What-The-Code")
4. **Press** `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+K` to start chatting with your code, or use the sidebar for more cool stuff

## Why youâ€™ll love it

- **Talk to your codebase** like itâ€™s your buddy
- **Clean up dead code** (unused imports, functions, and more) with a click
- **Automatic backups** (because we all make mistakes)
- **Restore files** from snapshots (undo button, but cooler)
- **Works with lots of languages** (but especially loves JavaScript/TypeScript)
