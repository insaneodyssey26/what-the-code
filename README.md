## FAQ

**What is dead code?**  
Code that is never used or run, like old functions or imports you forgot to delete.

**Why should I care about code quality?**  
Good code is easier to read, fix, and build on. It helps you and your team avoid bugs and confusion.

**What is a code snapshot?**  
A backup of your file before changes, so you can restore it if needed.

**Is my code sent to the cloud or kept private?**  
Your code is analyzed locally. Only your questions (and the code you ask about) are sent to Gemini if you use AI features.

**Do I need to know AI or machine learning to use this extension?**  
No! Just install, set your API key, and use the buttons or commands.

**Can I use this extension offline?**  
Most features work offline, but AI-powered answers need an internet connection.

**Will it change my code automatically?**  
No, it only suggests changes. You decide what to apply. Snapshots are saved before any edits.

**What are magic numbers?**  
Numbers in code with no explanation (like 42 or 0.8). Use named constants instead so your code is clear.

**How do I check code quality?**  
Click the ‚ÄúCode Quality‚Äù button in the status bar or run the command from the Command Palette.

**Which languages are supported?**  
Works best with JavaScript and TypeScript, but many features help with other languages too.

**Where do I put my Gemini API key?**  
In VS Code settings, search for ‚ÄúWhat-The-Code‚Äù.

**Can I undo changes?**  
Yes! Snapshots are saved before changes, so you can restore your code.
