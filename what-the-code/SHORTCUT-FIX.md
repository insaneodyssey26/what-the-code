# 🔧 Keyboard Shortcut Fixed!

## Issue Resolved ✅

The `Ctrl+Shift+K` shortcut was conflicting with VS Code's built-in "Delete Line" command, which is why it was deleting lines instead of opening the search dialog.

## New Keyboard Shortcut 🎯

**`Ctrl+Shift+Alt+K`** (Windows/Linux)  
**`Cmd+Shift+Alt+K`** (Mac)

## Alternative Ways to Access

If you prefer a different shortcut, you can:

### 1. Use Command Palette
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
- Type: **"Ask Your Code"**
- Press Enter

### 2. Click Status Bar
- Look for the **"🔍 Ask Code"** button in the bottom status bar
- Click it to open the search dialog

### 3. Customize the Shortcut
1. Go to **File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts**
2. Search for **"what-the-code.searchCode"**
3. Click the pencil icon and set your preferred shortcut

## Recommended Custom Shortcuts

Some good alternatives that won't conflict:
- `Ctrl+Alt+S` (Search)
- `Ctrl+Shift+F12` (Function key)
- `F12` (Simple function key)
- `Ctrl+Q` (Quick search)

## Test It Now! 🚀

1. Press **`Ctrl+Shift+Alt+K`**
2. You should see the search dialog with example queries
3. Try asking: **"React components that handle forms"**

The extension is now working correctly! 🎉
